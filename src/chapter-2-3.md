Introduction
------------

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an essential tool in various fields, including disaster management. AI technologies such as machine learning have the potential to provide decision-makers with valuable insights for responding to natural disasters. This chapter provides a background and fundamentals of AI, focusing on machine learning techniques.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
--------------------------------

Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI can be classified into two categories: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, and general or strong AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human can.

Machine Learning Techniques
---------------------------

Machine learning is a type of AI that allows machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning techniques: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled data. The model learns to predict output values based on input values. For example, a model can be trained to predict the damage caused by a natural disaster based on the location, magnitude, and duration of the event.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data. The model learns to identify patterns and relationships within the data. For example, unsupervised learning can be used to cluster similar regions based on their geological features.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves training a model to make decisions based on rewards and punishments. The model learns to take actions that maximize the reward and avoid actions that result in punishment. For example, reinforcement learning can be used to optimize evacuation routes based on traffic conditions during a disaster.

Conclusion
----------

Machine learning techniques are a fundamental component of AI and have the potential to improve disaster management. By training models on historical data, decision-makers can gain valuable insights into the likely outcomes of natural disasters. This information can be used to develop effective response plans and minimize the impact of these events on affected communities.
